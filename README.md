#Notes
The GUI in FileChooser.py selects a port and .jed file to send to an Arduino connected by USB.

The Arduino code is under development, but is based off of a working example for the Raspberry PI.
The biggest difference will be that the Raspberry Pi code uses linux libraries, and we are only using Arduino libraries and compatible code.
